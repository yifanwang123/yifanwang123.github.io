I am a third year Ph.D. student at University of Delaware, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Guangmo (Amo) Tong](https://udel.edu/~amotong/). And I am a member of [Comuptational Data Science Lab](https://udel.edu/~amotong/). My research insterests lie in Machine Learning and Social Network Analysis.
