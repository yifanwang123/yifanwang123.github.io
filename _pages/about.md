Hi! I am a third year Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at University of Delaware, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Guangmo (Amo) Tong](https://udel.edu/~amotong/). And I am a member of [Comuptational Data Science Lab](https://udel.edu/~amotong/). My research insterests lie in Machine Learning and Social Network Analysis.

I received my Master's degree in Transportation Engineering at University of Delaware. Prior to coming to UD, I received my Bachelor's degree in Chang'an University in China.
