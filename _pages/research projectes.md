# Learnability of Competitive Threshold Modles
![pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62770090/199111958-3bebb445-b7aa-4b0e-9c1e-696f519e3b41.png)

- Develop theoretical tools for analyzing sample complexity and generalization bounds for learning competitive diffusion models.
- Design a realizable hypothesis space for learning competitive diffusion models. We explicitly simulate the competitive diffusion threshold models by artificial neural networks with finite V.C. dimensions.
- Present theoretical analysis to analyze the PAC learnability of the present learning problem, as well as sample complexity and generalization bounds for learning competitive diffusion models.
- Formulate the efficient learning algorithm via linear programming with the polynomial number of constraints. We built the model through Python and solved it with the Cplex library.
